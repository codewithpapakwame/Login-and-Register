PHP and CSS Basics
PHP and CSS are two distinct programming languages used for web development.

PHP: a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It is used for server-side operations, such as managing data, handling forms, and connecting to databases.
CSS: a stylesheet language used for designing and styling webpage layouts. It is used for client-side operations, such as controlling the layout, visual design, and user experience of web pages.
Key Differences

Purpose: PHP is used for server-side programming, while CSS is used for client-side styling.
Functionality: PHP is used for creating dynamic content, handling user input, and interacting with databases, while CSS is used for controlling the visual design and layout of web pages.
Syntax: PHP syntax is similar to other programming languages, such as Java and C++, while CSS syntax is unique and used for styling web pages.
Using CSS with PHP CSS can be used with PHP to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Including CSS files: PHP can be used to include CSS files in HTML documents.
Generating CSS: PHP can be used to generate CSS styles dynamically based on user input or database data.
Styling PHP output: CSS can be used to style the output of PHP scripts, such as tables, forms, and other HTML elements.
Example of Using CSS with PHP

const webpack = require('webpack');

//...

<?php
// PHP code to generate HTML content
echo "<html>";
echo "<head>";
echo "<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='style.css'>";
echo "</head>";
echo "<body>";
echo "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
echo "</body>";
echo "</html>";
?>

//...

In this example, the PHP code generates an HTML document that includes a link to an external CSS file called “style.css”. The CSS file can be used to style the HTML content generated by the PHP script.
